1.	Project Title:-

  	Bank_Customer_Relationship_EDA

2.	Short Description:-

  	This project's objective is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into a bank customer dataset. The analysis aims to understand the dataset's        structure, identify missing values, analyze data distributions, and observe relationships between various features. The insights gained are intended to assist in further     modeling and decision-making.

3.	Tech Stack:-

  	Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.

    Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, including loading the BankCustomerData.csv file into a DataFrame.

    NumPy: A library for numerical operations.

    Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

    Seaborn: A library for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics, built on top of Matplotlib.

4.	Data Source:-

  	This data is taken from Kaggle.com.

5.	Highlights:-

  	Data Loading: The project successfully loads the BankCustomerData.csv file, making it ready for analysis.

    Data Exploration: It provides insights into the dataset's structure, including the presence of 42,639 rows and 17 columns with features like age, job, marital status,        education, balance, and loan history.

    Insights: The analysis observed significant correlations and patterns within the data, which are crucial for subsequent machine learning models.
